# rock-paper-scissors
The following project is going to be a simple implementation of the rock, paper and scissors game using the document object model! 

## Features used in development of the project
By utilising the DOM, I was able to make a simple rps game, which keeps track of the player scores updates them according to what they select, and what the computer selects! Below are just some things I used in this project:
- flexbox 
- Javascript to utilise the DOM 
- spans
- divs 
- buttons 
- utilising git to help keep track 
- range of CSS styling tools
